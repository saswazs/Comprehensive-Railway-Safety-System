# Comprehensive-Railway-Safety-System
Worked on developing a comprehensive railway safety system under the guidance of Dr. Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Assistant Professor at GSV, along with external mentorship from Sajil C K at ICFOSS.

## Introduction:
Railway safety is paramount for the efficient and secure operation of train networks worldwide. Accidents caused by collisions with foreign objects on railway tracks or natural calamities like landslides pose significant risks to both passengers and railway infrastructure. In response to these challenges, we propose the development of a comprehensive Railway Safety System aimed at preventing accidents and ensuring rapid response in case of emergencies.

## The Issue and Challenges:
Accidents involving objects falling onto railway tracks have tragically claimed many lives worldwide. These incidents are often the result of driver errors, structural issues with overbridges, or unforeseen circumstances. The challenges associated with preventing such accidents include the need for real�time detection, rapid communication, and prompt action to shut down traffic and traction in affected sections. Traditional safety measures may not provide the speed and effectiveness required to prevent these catastrophic events

## Project Objectives:
• Develop a comprehensive Railway Safety System to prevent accidents caused by falling objects and landslides. 
• Implement real-time detection and prediction mechanisms to ensure rapid response actions. 
• Enhance railway safety by integrating advanced sensors and simulation models. 
• Minimize the risk of derailments, property damage, and loss of life due to railway accidents.
